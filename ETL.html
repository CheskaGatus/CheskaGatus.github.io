<h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
<br>
  <p>The Toronto Parking Authority is a local Board of the City of Toronto which owns and operates the system of Municipal off-street parking lots ('Green P') and the on-street metered parking. Approximately 2.8 million parking tickets are issued annually across the City of Toronto. The Issued Parking Tickets dataset contains non-identifiable information relating to each parking ticket issued for each calendar year. The tickets are issued by Toronto Police Services (TPS) personnel as well as persons certified and authorized to issue tickets by TPS.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Our group chose to combine 2015 Issued Parking Tickets and Green P Parking. Final table has the following columns: Parking ID, Parking Rate, Address, Infraction Description and Set Fine Amount.

  <h6>Load:<h6>
  <br>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Created SQL connection.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Exported to MySQL. Since the final output is a DataFrame, we decided to load the data into a relational database.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Final table to be used in the production database has the following columns: Parking ID, Parking Rate, Address, Infraction Description and Set Fine Amount. Reason why these columns were selected is to determine possible relationship between parking rate vs infractions, and parking rate vs set fine amount. Other analysis that can be done would be: Which location has the highest infraction? What infraction is the most common? Does high parking rate causing infractions? Does high fine prevent infraction?
